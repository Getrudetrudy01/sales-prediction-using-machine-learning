# Sales Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python project for sales prediction using machine learning. Sales prediction involves estimating the amount of a product or service that people will buy based on various factors, such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform.

## Project Overview

The project aims to predict future sales by leveraging machine learning techniques. It involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset containing sales and advertising information. This dataset will be used to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the sales and advertising data, handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.

3. **Feature Selection/Engineering**: Select relevant features or create new features that may have a significant impact on sales. This step helps improve the model's performance by focusing on the most influential factors.

4. **Model Training**: Use machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks, to train a model on the labeled sales dataset. The model will learn patterns and relationships between the advertising features and the corresponding sales.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared score. This step helps determine how well the model predicts sales based on the given advertising features.

6. **Prediction**: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen advertising data. This allows businesses to estimate future sales based on their advertising strategies and decisions.

## Repository Files

The repository includes the following files:

1. `advertisement.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the sales prediction model. This notebook provides step-by-step instructions and explanations of the data preprocessing, feature selection/engineering, model training, model evaluation, and sales prediction.

2. `advertising.csv`: CSV file containing the sales and advertising dataset used for training and evaluating the sales prediction model. The file includes information such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and sales.

## How to Use

To use this project and train a sales prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Getrudetrudy01/sales-prediction.git
   ```

2. Open the `advertisement.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and train the sales prediction model.

4. If you want to use the trained model for prediction on new advertising data, make sure to have the necessary input data in a similar format as the `advertising.csv` file. You can load the trained model from the notebook and apply it to the new advertising data to predict the expected sales.

## Conclusion

The sales prediction project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to estimate future sales based on advertising factors. By training a model on a labeled sales dataset, the project aims to develop a sales prediction model that can assist businesses in making informed decisions about their advertising strategies. The Jupyter Notebook provided allows for an interactive and flexible environment to explore, develop, and enhance the sales prediction process.
